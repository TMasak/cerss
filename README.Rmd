# Covariance Estimation for Random Surfaces beyond Separability

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The purpose of this repo is to allow for reproducibility of the simulation studies and applications in papers

* Random Surface Covariance Estimation by Shifted Partial Tracing
[[arXiv:1912.12870v2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12870) (aka separable-plus-banded model),
* Principal Separable Component Analysis via the Partial Inner Product
[[arXiv:2007.12175v1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12175) (aka separable component decomposition),
* Inference and Computation for Sparsely Sampled Random Surfaces
[[arXiv:2103.10077v1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10077) (aka sparsely observed separable model),

which constitute the doctoral thesis of the author.

While the separable-plus-banded model and the separable component decomposition form the basis for the
`surfcov` package available [here](https://github.com/TMasak/surfcov), which was created later (and hence
is not used here, all the functions are wrapped in .R scripts here), this
repo provides the code for reproducing the results in the aforementioned papers. A total majority of
these were computed on a [cluster](https://www.epfl.ch/research/facilities/scitas/). The remainder of this
page shows examples how to reproduce (chunks of) the results on a single machine, running
R version 4.0.4 (2021-02-15).

There may be errors in the code (especially in parts not explicitly covered below). If a mistake is
found, please contact the author at tomas[tecka]masak[zavinac]epfl[tecka]ch.

### Separable-plus-banded Model

In the respective folder, [library.R](separable_plus_banded_model/library.R) contains functions implementing
all the algorithm from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12870).

Script [demo](separable_plus_banded_model/demo.R) shows how the functions can be used in form of a sample
simulation run.

Most of the results in Section 5.1 (Simulation Study) of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12870)
corresponding to the sripts in the [separate folder](separable_plus_banded_model/scripts) were computed on a cluster. 
The resulting data are stored in the [data folder](separable_plus_banded_model/data).

To reproduce, for example, the data underlying the left panel of Figure 2 on a single machine, open
[script_legendre_ar_buf.R](separable_plus_banded_model/scripts/script_legendre_ar_buf.R), comment out the
following two lines at the bottom of the script

``` r
library(parallel)
data <- mclapply(1:25,simulate,mc.cores=25)
```

and uncomment

``` r
# data <- lapply(1:25,simulate)
```

The script can then be run to reproduce
[legendre_ar_buf.RData](separable_plus_banded_model/data/legendre_ar_buf.RData).

The resulting data are in turn used by [results.R](separable_plus_banded_model/results.R) to create
the left panel of Figure 2.

TODO: I have apparently used the triangular kernel instead of the Epanechnikov kernel in the simulations
